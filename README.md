# The Little Alchemist

A little schemer schemes; a little alchemist creates elixirs.

The [Little Schemer, 4th Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/) exercises in Elixir.

This isn't complete, but I'm walking through some of the questions and attempting to create similar solutions.

No promises that my Elixir is idiomatic.

No promises that my solutions are correct.

Just for fun.
